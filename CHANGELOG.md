## v1.2.5 ... (19 MARCH 20)

### Fixes:
`+` Fixed wide video container.

### Notes:
`*` YouTube now uses a different system for displaying the videos on (only) the homepage. Due to how it works, manipulating it via CSS only is difficult. I have opted to just disable all extra CSS rules for the homepage.

## v1.2.4 ... (02 NOVEMBER 19)

### Fixes:
`+` Fixed main video container as previous rules worked on the subscriptions page, but not on the Home page. Now using different rules that seem to work for both.

## v1.2.3 ... (01 AUGUST 19)

### Fixes:
`+` Fixed Stretch video to fill player, as some videos end up being stretched too far and cutting off a bit of the sides of the videos.

## v1.2.2 ... (02 JULY 19)

### Additions:
`+` Added an option to stretch the main video container on YouTube to be a bit wider. "Especially on a 2K monitor, the default YouTube container is ridiculously narrow, but even on 1080p, using this means at least one more column of videos visible."

## v1.0.3 ... (23 JULY 18)

### Additions:
`+` Added an option to move the "Next-Bar" to the right side of the video player.

### Changes:
`+` Made scrollbar thinner so the video player has a bit more space to take up.

### Notes:
`*` "Next-Bar" to the right side of the video player option will kind of mess with video right side controls if enabled or disabled while on the video page.
