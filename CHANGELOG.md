### Notes:
`*` YT now uses a different system for displaying the videos on (only) the homepage. Due to how it works, manipulating it via CSS only is difficult. I have opted to just disable all extra CSS rules for the home page.

## v1.2.4 ... (02 NOVEMBER 19)

### Fixes:
`+` Fixed main video container as previous rules worked on the subscriptions page, but not on Home page. Now using different rules that seem to work for both.

## v1.2.3 ... (01 AUGUST 19)

### Fixes:
`+` Fixed Stretch video to fill player, as some videos end up being stretched too far and cutting off a bit of the sides of the videos.

## v1.2.2 ... (02 JULY 19)

### Additions:
`+` Added an option to stretch the main video container on youtube to be a bit wider. `Especially on a 2K monitor the default youtube container is ridiculously narrow, but even on 1080p using this means at least one more column of videos visible.`
